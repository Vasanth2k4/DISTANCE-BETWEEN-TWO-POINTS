# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points.
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the math function.
### Step 2: 
Make two list which consist of two variables and initialize them.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
We do this buy using the sqrt function.
### Step 5: 
print the value.
### PROGRAM:
```python
###Program to find the distance be.

x1,y1=10,6
x2,y2=4,2
dis=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(dis))
```
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points is found.
